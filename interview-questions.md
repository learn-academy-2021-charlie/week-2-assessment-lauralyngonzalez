# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is the process of performing a repeated action a number of
  times or until a certain condition is met. Arrays and strings are iterable
  and the index is used to iterate over them.

2. The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: .map() has predefined parameters for the value, index, and the calling
  array. It's a higher order function that can take a function as an argument or
  return a function. Higher order functions also require at least one argument. So
  for .map() the value is required and the others are optional.

3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is a shortcut used to reference the object's
  values. If the object is named fruit and it has the key-value pair "apple: 5",
  for the number of apples, then instead of doing fruit.apple, we can use object
  destructuring to create a shortcut named numApples to get the 5.

4. What is the difference between an object and a class?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint for an object. An object is an instance of
  a class. There can be many objects instantiated from one class. For example,
  the class can be Car and there can be many car objects.

5. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: The method super() is used when creating a class that's inheriting
  from another class. When an object is instantiated the constructor for the
  child class is called and super() will call the constructor of the parent class.
  So the child will have the data that its parent has.
